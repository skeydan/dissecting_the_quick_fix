## Tech solutionism

</br /></br /></br /></br />

> The tendency to use technology to solve a societal (political, organizational, environmental ...) problem.

::: notes
Often defined as "the belief that technology can be used to solve any problem". Doesn't have to be put in so strong a way, though.

Let me give just one example to make clear what this is about.
:::

## "Axon Announces TASER Drone Development to Address Mass Shootings" (Press Release, 06/02/22)

. . .

</br /></br />

> But the Taser drone is "completely independent" of gun control, Smith told me. I don't think legislators should say 'Axon will fix this.' ... I don't want us to be an excuse for inaction."

::: notes
So you see, there is no need to claim this is a complete solution. What matters, in cases like this, is that your product / idea just wonderfully fits the situation.
:::

::: notes
Now, it would be easy to go on bringing other examples like this, disgusting examples, infuriating examples ... But there is not much use to this.

If we rely on (shared) disgust and outrage only ...

-   we won't be able to spot less aversive cases
-   we won't be able to convince others
:::

## Let's instead see what's so seductive about it

::: notes
-   It *solves* a problem. (A tautology, but an important one.)
-   It solves a *problem*. (It matters.)
-   It solves a *hard* problem. (Why else would we care.)
-   It solves a *problem* we don't really know how to solve otherwise. (And there are many of them.)
-   It solves a *problem* whose other solutions would involve *sacrifices*. (That's the last thing we want.)
-   It solves a problem we're terribly *scared* about.
:::

. . .

<br /> <br /> <br />

It solves a problem we're terribly scared about.
:::

## We need to be more clear about how we assess "solutions"

::: notes
We would like

-   A framework to analyze a "solution" along explicitly stated, communicable, and weightable dimensions.
-   BUT: An analysis may NOT be restricted to the purely technical.
-   Suggestion: For maximum openness and generality, follow the **W**-questions (what, where, when, who, why - plus how).
-   To counter-balance the usual type of discourse, we'll want to re-distribute focus from the WHAT to the *WHO* and *WHY*.
:::

. . .

<br /> <br />

Commonly, the focus is on the *what;* and maybe, the *where* and the *when*. (Sometimes, even the *how*).

<br />

I would like to focus on the neglected [*why*]{style="color: #645394;"} and [*who*]{style="color: #645394;"}.

# Not "just" [*what*]{style="color: #645394;"} (and [*where*]{style="color: #645394;"} and [*when*]{style="color: #645394;"} and [*how*]{style="color: #645394;"}): But [*why*]{style="color: #645394;"} and [*how*]{style="color: #645394;"}

::: notes
Since those won't be in-focus: What do I mean by WHAT, WHERE, WHEN, and HOW?

-   *What* does the "solution" do? I.e. the complete technical workflow, starting from what datasets were used, how a model was trained, up to and including how it was evaluated.
-   *Where*, *when*, and *to whom* will the "solution" be applied? I.e. the complete (geographical, social, political) context.
-   *How* exactly will the solution be applied? Details matter.

# Dissecting the [*why*]{style="color: #645394;"}

## [*Why*]{style="color: #645394;"}: What'll you hear

::: notes
-   We want to help.
-   We care.
-   We're here for you.
:::

. . .

<br /> <br /> <br />

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
We're here for you.
:::

## [*Why*]{style="color: #645394;"}: What you *won't* hear - individual reasons

::: notes
-   This will look good on my resume.
-   This just might get me a job at \[company x\].
-   This is something one could launch a startup for.
-   This is a great reason to learn/use technology \[insert currently-hyped technology here\].
-   It's just so cool that this *can even be done*.
:::

It's just *so* cool that this can even be done.
:::

## [*Why*]{style="color: #645394;"}: What you *won't* hear - organizational reasons

::: notes
-   If we do this, we'll be strengthening our existing \[but always threatened\] monopoly.
-   If we do this, we distract from \[that unfortunate thing that went through the news\].
-   If we do this, we'll score high on the *Benefactors of Humanity* list.
:::

. . .

<br /> <br /> <br />

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
We're the good guys.
:::

## [*Why*]{style="color: #645394;"}: What you won't hear - side effects

::: notes
-   If we implement this, we'll be able to harvest valuable data \[to be used in targeted advertising\].
-   If we implement this, we'll be able to harvest valuable data \[to be used to train our neural networks\].
-   If we do this, we'll have a foot in the door to \[build that yet more impactful thing\].
:::

. . .

<br /> <br /> <br />

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
This will make us tenfold as strong.
:::

## [*Why*]{style="color: #645394;"}: What you *won't* hear - power

::: notes
-   If we do this, the government will not be able to get along without us.
-   If we do this, we can seriously shape how people live.
-   If we do this, we can seriously shape how people think.
-   If we do this, we can seriously shape how people feel.
-   If we do this, we can seriously shape who people *are*.
:::

. . .

<br /> <br /> <br />

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
We define what it means to be human.

# Dissecting the [*who*]{style="color: #645394;"}

## [Who]{style="color: #645394;"} is *who*?

<br />

::: notes
Who is ambiguous and could mean many things. I'm using it in a specific sense.
:::

-   Who designs, implements, and hosts the "solution"?
-   Who processes its data?
-   Who knows how it works, and can fix problems?

<br />

This is not synonymous with: *Who is accountable when things go wrong.*

::: notes
Let's investigate this by example: Education technology (a.k.a. edtech)
:::

## Edtech: What'll you hear

::: notes
-   With \[adaptive technology x\], each learner's individual needs are met.
-   Thanks to \[x\], teachers have time to focus on what they do best.
:::

. . .

<br /> <br /> <br />

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
We make your lives easier.
:::

## Edtech: What you *won't* hear -- how it works

::: notes
-   We record, process and store a lot of \[extremely\] personal data.
-   We constantly track and analyze your behavior.
-   You learn; *we're learning* from you.
:::

. . .

<br /> <br /> <br />

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
You learn; *we're learning from you.*
:::

## Edtech: What you *won't* hear -- market domination

::: notes
-   Once we have "gotten in", network effects will make it things very hard for hypothetical competitors.
-   Once we have "gotten in", anyone who wants a share has to play according to our rules.
:::

. . .

<br /> <br /> <br />

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
Want in? Follow our rules.
:::

## Edtech: What you *won't* hear -- shaping society

::: notes
-   We define *how* people learn.
-   We define *what* is learned.
-   We define what *deserves* to be learnt.
-   We define what *needs* to be forgotten.
:::

<br /> <br /> <br />

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
We define what's worth learning.
:::

## Edtech: What you *won't* hear -- humanity

::: notes
-   We define the past.
-   We define the present.
-   We define the future.
:::

. . .

<br /> <br /> <br />

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
We define the future.

# Can you say again how this is about the [*who*]{style="color: #645394;"}?

::: notes
We said that the WHO was about who designs, implements, and hosts the solution; who has access to its data; who can fix it; who is accountable.
:::

## Imagine a (continuous) dimension, labeled *public \<-\> private*

+-------------+------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------+

::: notes
Then what difference would it make who's the who?
:::

## Difference no. 1: Business models

::: notes
-   Public institutions do not need to extract private data to make money.

-   Public institutions do not need to feed back fresh data into their large deep learning models.

-   Public institutions do not need to worry about their competitors.
:::

. . .

<br /> <br /> <br />

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
It wouldn't have to be about *business*.
:::

## Difference no. 2: Political and legal aspects

::: notes
-   Public institutions can be held to to ensure transparency.
-   Public institutions can be held to to ensure that errors are fixed.
-   Public institutions can be held *accountable*.
:::

. . .

<br /> <br /> <br />

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
Accountability is possible.
:::

## Difference no. 3: Human rights and values

::: notes
-   Public institutions can be held to respect human rights.

-   Public institutions can be held to prioritize values over feasibility.

-   Public institutions can be held to support -- not eliminate -- people's individuality.

-   Public institutions can be held to minimize, not enforce, social-credit mechanisms.
:::

. . .

<br /> <br /> <br />

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
The *subject* is still an option.
:::

## Yes but. How does this concern *me*?

::: notes
I'm neither a state nor a CEO. How can I influence any of that?

-   But we all make choices (where we work, how we vote, whether we engage politically...)
-   We may feel we have little agency; but perhaps there are options that are within what we can handle
-   If nothing else, we can try to keep questioning the things we're told.
-   And there is one thing we keep getting told, in various contexts and y various actors, over and over again.
:::

. . .

<br /> <br /> <br />

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
Don't fall for the *blame-the-individual* strategy.
:::

## A systemic view

::: notes
Shifting responsibility to individuals has been, and is, the strategy of influential actors in various domains since (probably) forever. (Actors who want to keep the status quo.)

Take climate change: Cleaning up the woods, or buying fewer plastic-wrapped goods, or trying to reduce how much you heat your apartment ... all that's nice, and should be done, but does not compare in any way to the effects of global phenomena like, say, bitcoin.

<br />

> To the extent that it defines ethical technology in terms of individual design decisions, tech ethics will divert scrutiny away from the economic and political factors that drive digital injustice, limiting our ability to address these forces.

::: notes
So maybe a first step is in our imagination: Imagine ...
:::

## Maybe data science could be different

<br />

What if ...

<br />

-   Data were used not to perpetuate, but [*change*]{style="color: #645394;"} the status quo?
-   Data were used to make social relations more [*egalitarian*]{style="color: #645394;"}, more [*just*]{style="color: #645394;"}?
-   Data were used to [*subvert*]{style="color: #645394;"} privileges, not [*reinforce*]{style="color: #645394;"} them?
