## Tech solutionism

Definition, sort of

## The ugly face of solutionism

(disgusting examples)

hubris

## But if we rely on (shared) disgust and outrage only ...

-   we won't be able to spot less flagrant cases
-   we won't be able to convince others

## Let's instead see what's so seductive about it

-   It *solves* a problem.
-   It solves a *problem*.
-   It solves a *hard* *problem*.
-   It solves a *problem* we don't really know how to solve otherwise.
-   It solves a *problem* whose other solutions involve *sacrifices*.
-   It solves a problem we're terribly scared about.

# We need to be more clear about how we assess "solutions"

## The desiderate

-   A framework to analyze a "solution" along explicit, communicable, and weighteable dimensions.
-   Essential point: An analysis may NOT be restricted to the purely technical.
-   Suggestion: For maximum openness and generality, follow the **W**-questions (plus **how**).
-   To counter-balance the usual type of discourse, we'll want to re-distribute focus from the WHAT to the *WHO* and *WHY*.

# Not just WHAT - and WHERE and WHEN and HOW - but WHO and WHY

## WHAT, WHERE, WHEN, HOW

-   *What* does the "solution" do? I.e. the complete technical workflow, starting from what datasets were used, how a model was trained, up to and including how it was evaluated.

-   *Where*, *when*, and *to whom* will the "solution" be applied? I.e. the complete (geographical, social, political) context.

-   How exactly will the solution be applied? Details matter.

# Dissecting the WHY

## WHY: What is said

-   We want to help.
-   We care.
-   We're here for you.

## WHY: What is *not* said - individual reasons

-   This will look good on my resume.
-   This might just get me a job at \[company x\].
-   This is something one could launch a startup for.
-   This is a great reason to learn/use technology \[insert currently-hyped technology here\].
-   It's just so cool that this *can even be done*.

## WHY: What is *not* said - organizational reasons

-   If we do this, we'll score high on the *Benefactors of Humanity* list.

-   If we do this, we counteract the negative image recently created by \[insert here\].

-   If we do this, we'll be strengthening our existing \[but always threatened\] monopoly.

## WHY: What is *not* said - useful side effects

-   If we implement this, we'll be able to harvest valuable data \[to be used in targeted advertising\].
-   If we implement this, we'll be able to harvest valuable data \[to be used to train our neural networks\].
-   If we do this, we'll have a foot in the door to \[build a yet more useful thing\].

## WHY: What is *not* said - power

-   If we do this, \[government x, public org y, ...\] will not be able to get rid of us.
-   If we do this, we can seriously shape how people live.
-   If we do this, we can seriously shape how people think.
-   If we do this, we can seriously shape how people feel.
-   If we do this, we can seriously shape what people *are*.

# Dissecting the WHO

## WHO means what?

-   Who designs, implements, and hosts the "solution"?
-   Who processes its data?
-   Who knows how it works?
-   Who is accountable?

## Who is *WHO*?

Basic assumption:

**Agents can be located on a dimension of democratic "electedness"/"justifiedness", with the ideal democracy on one side and privately-managed institutions on the other (corporations, foundations, NGOs).**

# Two examples (of many) where the WHO matters:  education & climate change

## Education technology: What is said

-   With \[adaptive technology x\], each learner's individual needs are met.

-   Thanks to \[x\], pressure on teachers diminishes.

## Education technology: What is *not* said

-   We restrict teachers' options to shape their work.
-   We record, process and store a lot of \[extremely\] personal data.
-   You learn; *we're learning*.
-   We define *what* is learned.
-   We define *how* people learn.
-   We define what is conveyed *between the lines*.

## Education technology: Why public, not private?

### (1) Business models

-   Democratic institutions do not need to extract private data to make money.

-   Democratic institutions don't need to feed back fresh data into their large deep learning models.

#### 

### (2) Political and legal aspects

-   Democratic institutions can be held to to ensure transparency.
-   Democratic institutions can be held *accountable*.
-   Democratic institutions can be held to to ensure that errors are fixed.

### (3) Human rights and values

-   Democratic institutions can be held to respect human rights.

-   Democratic institutions can be held to prioritize values over feasibility.

-   Democratic institutions can be held to support -- not eliminate -- people's individuality.

-   Democratic institutions can be held to minimize social-credit mechanisms operating through technology use.

## *Fixing* cimate change: The technologies

-   Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS)
-   Air Source Heat Pumps
-   Clean Hydrogen
-   Carbon offsets

::: notes
-   Carbon offsets: evicting people from their lands, local food crises,
:::

## *Fixing* climate change: What it says and what it means

-   "net zero"
-   "resilience", "adaptation", "mitigation"

## Revisiting the Who is *WHO*?

-   With topics like climate change, it is not enough to insist on locally-elected democratic institutions.

## *Fixing* climate change: The seduction

-   If we apply fix \[x\], we don't have to change our lifestyles.
-   If we apply fix \[x\], we don't have to change society.
-   If we apply fix \[x\], we don't have to give up our privileges.

## *Fixing* climate change: Why public, not private?

-   Democratic institutions can be held to not favor strategies that result in monetary gain (example: carbon credits)
-   Democratic institutions can be expected not to take the action in question to further their influence, strengthen their power, and promote their conceptions of how the world ought to be.
-   Democratic institutions can be held to favor actions that *promote social justice*.
-   Democratic institutions can be expected not to have a need for *greenwashing*.
-   Democratic institutions can be expected not to act under the incentive of extracting data and powering their AIs.
-   Democratic institutions can be expected not to use climate concerns as a business opportunity likely to attract large amounts of venture capital.
-   Democratic institutions can be held to implement non-individualistic solutions.

### WHOs I would like

not go into detail

### WHYs I would like

-   I can't sleep because of this
-   We have a responsibility
-   We have no right to ...
-   This is so *unjust*
