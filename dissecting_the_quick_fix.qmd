## Tech solutionism

> The tendency to use technology to solve any (organizational, societal, environmental, ...) problem.

::: notes
Often defined as "the belief that technology can be used to solve any problem". I think this is unnecessarily generalizing. Doesn't have to be *any* problem; enough to see it in action at the problem at hand.

::: notes
Commonly linked to Evgenij Morozov's *From Save Everything, Click Here: The Folly of Technological Solutionism* (2013). But did exist before, under various names; and the thing itself must be (at least) as old as humanity itself.
:::

::: notes
Now, it would be easy to show disgusting examples, examples like the one given by Sean Johnston in his 2020 book *Techno-Fixers*, about using air conditioning to turn down the likelihood of race riots.

But if we rely on (shared) disgust and outrage only ...

-   we won't be able to spot less aversive cases
-   we won't be able to convince others
:::

## Let's instead see what's so seductive about it

::: notes
-   It *solves* a problem. (A tautology, but an important one.)
-   It solves a *problem*. (It matters.)
-   It solves a *hard* problem. (Why else would we care.)
-   It solves a *problem* we don't really know how to solve otherwise. (And there are many of them.)
-   It solves a *problem* whose other solutions would involve *sacrifices*. (That's the last thing we want.)
-   It solves a problem we're terribly *scared* about.

It solves a problem we're terribly scared about.

## We need to be more clear about how we assess "solutions"

::: notes
We would like

-   A framework to analyze a "solution" along explicitly stated, communicable, and weightable dimensions.
-   BUT: An analysis may NOT be restricted to the purely technical.
-   Suggestion: For maximum openness and generality, follow the **W**-questions (what, where, when, who, why - plus how).
-   To counter-balance the usual type of discourse, we'll want to re-distribute focus from the WHAT to the *WHO* and *WHY*.
:::

. . .

<br /> <br /> <br />

Commonly, the focus is on the *what* (and maybe, the *where* and the *when*, and sometimes, even the *how*).

I would like to focus on the neglected [*why*]{style="color: #645394;"} and [*who*]{style="color: #645394;"}.

# Not "just" [*what*]{style="color: #645394;"} (and [*where*]{style="color: #645394;"} and [*when*]{style="color: #645394;"} and [*how*]{style="color: #645394;"}): But [*why*]{style="color: #645394;"} and [*how*]{style="color: #645394;"}

::: notes
Since those won't be in-focus: What do I mean by WHAT, WHERE, WHEN, and HOW?

-   *What* does the "solution" do? I.e. the complete technical workflow, starting from what datasets were used, how a model was trained, up to and including how it was evaluated.
-   *Where*, *when*, and *to whom* will the "solution" be applied? I.e. the complete (geographical, social, political) context.
-   *How* exactly will the solution be applied? Details matter.

## [*Why*]{style="color: #645394;"}: What'll you hear

::: notes
-   We want to help.
-   We care.
-   We're here for you.

## [*Why*]{style="color: #645394;"}: What you *won't* hear - individual reasons

::: notes
-   This will look good on my resume.
-   This just might get me a job at \[company x\].
-   This is something one could launch a startup for.
-   This is a great reason to learn/use technology \[insert currently-hyped technology here\].
-   It's just so cool that this *can even be done*.

It's just *so* cool that this can even be done.
:::

## [*Why*]{style="color: #645394;"}: What you *won't* hear - organizational reasons

::: notes
-   If we do this, we'll be strengthening our existing \[but always threatened\] monopoly.
-   If we do this, we distract from \[that unfortunate thing that went through the news\].
-   If we do this, we'll score high on the *Benefactors of Humanity* list.
:::

<br /> <br /> <br />

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
We're the good guys.
:::

## [*Why*]{style="color: #645394;"}: What you won't hear - side effects

::: notes
-   If we implement this, we'll be able to harvest valuable data \[to be used in targeted advertising\].
-   If we implement this, we'll be able to harvest valuable data \[to be used to train our neural networks\].
-   If we do this, we'll have a foot in the door to \[build that yet more impactful thing\].

<br /> <br /> <br />

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
This will make us tenfold as strong.
:::

## [*Why*]{style="color: #645394;"}: What you *won't* hear - power

::: notes
-   If we do this, the government will not be able to get along without us.
-   If we do this, we can seriously shape how people live.
-   If we do this, we can seriously shape how people think.
-   If we do this, we can seriously shape how people feel.
-   If we do this, we can seriously shape who people *are*.

. . .

<br /> <br /> <br />

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
We define what it means to be human.

# Dissecting the [*who*]{style="color: #645394;"}

## [Who]{style="color: #645394;"} is *who*?

<br />

::: notes
Who is ambiguous and could mean many things. I'm using it in a specific sense.
:::

-   Who designs, implements, and hosts the "solution"?
-   Who processes its data?
-   Who knows how it works, and can fix problems?

<br />

This is not synonymous with: *Who is accountable when things go wrong.*

::: notes
Let's investigate this by example: Education technology (a.k.a. edtech)
:::

## Edtech: What'll you hear

::: notes
-   With \[adaptive technology x\], each learner's individual needs are met.
-   Thanks to \[x\], teachers have time to focus on what they do best.
:::

. . .

<br /> <br /> <br />

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
We make your lives easier.
:::

## Edtech: What you *won't* hear -- how it works

::: notes
-   We record, process and store a lot of \[extremely\] personal data.
-   We constantly track and analyze your behavior.
-   You learn; *we're learning* from you.
:::

. . .

<br /> <br /> <br />

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
You learn; *we're learning from you.*
:::

## Edtech: What you *won't* hear -- market domination

::: notes
-   Once we have "gotten in", network effects will make it things very hard for hypothetical competitors.
-   Once we have "gotten in", anyone who wants a share has to play according to our rules.
:::

. . .

<br /> <br /> <br />

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
Want in? Follow our rules.
:::

## Edtech: What you *won't* hear -- shaping society

::: notes
-   We define *how* people learn.
-   We define *what* is learned.
-   We define what *deserves* to be learnt.
-   We define what *needs* to be forgotten.
:::

<br /> <br /> <br />

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
We define what's worth learning.
:::

## Edtech: What you *won't* hear -- humanity

::: notes
-   We define the past.
-   We define the present.
-   We define the future.
:::

. . .

<br /> <br /> <br />

::: {style="text-align: center;"}
We define the future.

# Can you say again how this is about the [*who*]{style="color: #645394;"}?

::: notes
We said that the WHO was about who designs, implements, and hosts the solution; who has access to its data; who can fix it; who is accountable.

## Imagine a (continuous) dimension, labeled *public \<-\> private*

::: notes
Then what difference would it make who's the who?
:::

## Difference no. 1: Business models

::: notes
-   Public institutions do not need to extract private data to make money.

-   Public institutions do not need to feed back fresh data into their large deep learning models.

-   Public institutions do not need to worry about their competitors.
:::

. . .

<br /> <br /> <br />

::: {style="text-align: center;"}

It wouldn't have to be about *business*.

:::

## Difference no. 2: Political and legal aspects

::: notes
-   Public institutions can be held to to ensure transparency.
-   Public institutions can be held to to ensure that errors are fixed.
-   Public institutions can be held *accountable*.
:::

. . .

<br /> <br /> <br />

::: {style="text-align: center;"}

Accountability is possible.

:::

## Difference no. 3: Human rights and values

::: notes
-   Public institutions can be held to respect human rights.

-   Public institutions can be held to prioritize values over feasibility.

-   Public institutions can be held to support -- not eliminate -- people's individuality.

-   Public institutions can be held to minimize, not enforce, social-credit mechanisms.
:::

. . .

<br /> <br /> <br />

::: {style="text-align: center;"}

The *subject* is still an option.

:::

## Yes but. How does this concern *me*? 

::: notes
I'm neither a state nor a CEO. How can I influence any of that?

-   But we all make choices (where we work, how we vote, whether we engage politically...)
-   We may feel we have little agency; but perhaps we can think about how much there is or could be
-   At the very least, we can try to doubt, question, be open to surprising ideas
:::

. . .

<br /> <br /> <br />

::: {style="text-align: center;"}

Maybe we can start by being open to new ideas (that transcend the dichotomies).

:::

## A third way of thinking about data (Salome Viljoen)

-   Data as person-like: I have an inalienable right over my data.
-   Data as property-like: I need to get compensated for my data.

Both views neglect that *my* data also provide information about *you*.

::: notes
She calls this horizontal data relations.

e.g.: genetic data, profiling and minority groups, ...
:::

## Data work could be different

Data can be used to make social relations more egalitarian, more just.
