## Tech solutionism

> The tendency to use technology to solve any (organizational, societal, environmental, ...) problem.

::: notes
Often defined as "the belief that technology can be used to solve any problem". Want to allow for a range of views instead.

Commonly linked to Evgenij Morozov's *From Save Everything, Click Here: The Folly of Technological Solutionism* (2013).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now, it would be easy to show disgusting examples, examples like the one given by Sean Johnston in his 2020 book *Techno-Fixers*, about using air conditioning to turn down the likelihood of race riots.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

But if we rely on (shared) disgust and outrage only ...

-   we won't be able to spot less aversive cases
-   we won't be able to convince others
:::

# Let's see what's so seductive about it

::: notes
-   It *solves* a problem. (A tautology, but an important one.)
-   It solves a *problem*. (Shifting focus, ...)
-   It solves a *hard* *problem*. (Why else would we care.)
-   It solves a *problem* we don't really know how to solve otherwise. (And there are many of them.)
-   It solves a *problem* whose other solutions would involve *sacrifices*. (That's the last thing we want.)
-   It solves a problem we're terribly *scared* about.
:::

# We need to be more clear about how we assess "solutions"

::: notes
We would like

-   A framework to analyze a "solution" along explicit, communicable, and weighteable dimensions.
-   Essential point: An analysis may NOT be restricted to the purely technical.
-   Suggestion: For maximum openness and generality, follow the **W**-questions (plus **how**).
-   To counter-balance the usual type of discourse, we'll want to re-distribute focus from the WHAT to the *WHO* and *WHY*.
:::

# Not just WHAT - and WHERE and WHEN and HOW - but WHO and WHY

::: notes
Since those won't be in-focus: What do I mean by WHAT, WHERE, WHEN, and HOW?

-   *What* does the "solution" do? I.e. the complete technical workflow, starting from what datasets were used, how a model was trained, up to and including how it was evaluated.

-   *Where*, *when*, and *to whom* will the "solution" be applied? I.e. the complete (geographical, social, political) context.

-   How exactly will the solution be applied? Details matter.

# Dissecting the WHY

# WHY: What is said

::: notes
-   We want to help.
-   We care.
-   We're here for you.
:::

# WHY: What is *not* said - individual reasons

::: notes
-   This will look good on my resume.
-   This might just get me a job at \[company x\].
-   This is something one could launch a startup for.
-   This is a great reason to learn/use technology \[insert currently-hyped technology here\].
-   It's just so cool that this *can even be done*.
:::

# WHY: What is *not* said - organizational reasons

::: notes
-   If we do this, we'll score high on the *Benefactors of Humanity* list.

-   If we do this, we counteract the negative image recently created by \[insert here\].

-   If we do this, we'll be strengthening our existing \[but always threatened\] monopoly.
:::

# WHY: What is *not* said - useful side effects

::: notes
-   If we implement this, we'll be able to harvest valuable data \[to be used in targeted advertising\].
-   If we implement this, we'll be able to harvest valuable data \[to be used to train our neural networks\].
-   If we do this, we'll have a foot in the door to \[build a yet more useful thing\].
:::

# WHY: What is *not* said - power

::: notes
-   If we do this, \[government x, public org y, ...\] will not be able to get rid of us.
-   If we do this, we can seriously shape how people live.
-   If we do this, we can seriously shape how people think.
-   If we do this, we can seriously shape how people feel.
-   If we do this, we can seriously shape what people *are*.

# Dissecting the WHO

# Questions to ask

::: notes
-   Who designs, implements, and hosts the "solution"?
-   Who processes its data?
-   Who knows how it works?
-   Who is accountable?
:::

# An example of where it matters: education technology (edtech)

# Edtech: What is said

::: notes
-   With \[adaptive technology x\], each learner's individual needs are met.

-   Thanks to \[x\], teachers have time to focus on what they do best.
:::

# Edtech: What is *not* said -- modus operandi

::: notes
-   We record, process and store a lot of \[extremely\] personal data.
-   You learn; *we're learning* from you.
:::

# Edtech: What is *not* said -- market domination

::: notes
-   Once we have "gotten in", network effects will make it very hard on eventual competitors.
-   Once we have "gotten in", anyone who wants a share has to conform to our API.
:::

# Edtech: What is *not* said -- shaping society

::: notes
-   We define *how* people learn.
-   We define *what* is learned.
-   We define what *deserves* to be learnt.
-   We define what *needs* to be forgotten.
:::

# Edtech: What is *not* said -- past, present, future

::: notes
-   We define the past.
-   We define the present.
-   We define the future.
:::

# Edtech: So how exactly is this about the WHO?

::: notes
We said that the WHO was about who designs, implements, and hosts the solution; who has access to its data; who can fix it; who is accountable.
:::

Imagine a scenario where we have a continuous dimension, with ends labeled public and private, where organizations/institutions can be located anywhere and that is understood about like this:

|                 | public \[institution\]                                     | private \[organization\]     |
|----------------|-------------------------------------|------------------|
| examples        | \[real\] democracy                                         | corporation, foundation, NGO |
| characteristics | democratic election process, transparency, accountability, |                              |
| values          | fairness, justice, human rights                            | depends on org in question   |
| caveat!         | It is not enough to think on a local ("state") level.      |                              |

Then how would the issues brought up be affected by who's the WHO?

# Difference no. 1: Business models

::: notes
-   Public institutions do not need to extract private data to make money.

-   Public institutions don't need to feed back fresh data into their large deep learning models.
:::

# Difference no. 2: Political and legal aspects

::: notes
-   Public institutions can be held to to ensure transparency.
-   Public institutions can be held *accountable*.
-   Public institutions can be held to to ensure that errors are fixed.
:::

# Difference no. 3: Human rights and values

::: notes
-   Public institutions can be held to respect human rights.

-   Public institutions can be held to prioritize values over feasibility.

-   Public institutions can be held to support -- not eliminate -- people's individuality.

-   Public institutions can be held to minimize social-credit mechanisms operating through technology use.
:::

## Now this may sound like it doesn't concern me

::: notes
more abstract than the WHY, harder to influence
:::

-   But we all make choices (where we work, how we vote, whether we engage politically...)
-   We may feel we have little agency; but perhaps we can think about how much there is or could be
-   At the very least, we can try to doubt, question, be open to surprising ideas

## 

## An example: Escaping the data dichotomy (Viljoen)

-   Data as person-like: Inalienable right over one's data
-   Data as property-like: Compensation

Both views neglect that my data also provide information about *you*.

(horizontal data relations)

::: notes
e.g.: genetic data, profiling
:::

## Data work could be different

Data can be used to make social relations more egalitarian, more just.

Take the perspective of those affected
