***It is easy to be hating that kind of stuff***

or, put differently,

***Among like-minded people, it is easy to despise tech solutionism.***

<br /><br />

But there is a problem.

*What if those like-minded people, who despise tech solutionism, work in
the tech industry themselves -- an thus, might do something that does
have positive impact?*

<br />

Here's a dilemma. Now, I was looking for a way to reduce that type of
cognitive dissonance.

*Can we analyse, "document" a "solution" analogously to how we [should]
document models and datasets?*

<br /><br />

# A structured way to analyse "solutions"

<br /><br />

For such a structured-analysis approach, what are the *sine qua non*s?

There's at least one:

## An analysis may NOT be restricted to the purely technical.

Suggestion: For maximum openness and generality, follow the
**W**-questions (plus **how**).

<br />

How to *weight* those will depend on the individual "solution", and will
require deliberation as well.

In general, to counter-balance established ways of thinking, we'll want
to re-distribute focus from the WHAT to the WHO and WHY.

<br /><br />

## Not just WHAT, but WHO, WHY, and HOW (and WHERE and WHEN and to WHOM)

<br />

### WHAT

What does the "solution" do?

This is to be understood as comprising the complete technical workflow,
starting from what datasets were used, how a model was trained, etc. up
to and including how it was evaluated.

<br />

### WHERE and WHEN and to WHOM

Where, when, and to whom will the "solution" be applied?

This is meant to designate elaboration of the complete (geographical,
social, political) context.

<br />

### WHO

Who developed, implements, has control over the "solution"? Who has
access to its data?

A primary type of distinction (though it too has to be seen in
context!): *company vs. public institution*

<br />

### WHY

Why was this solution developed? Complementing the publicly stated
motivation, motivations could include

-   extracting data (maybe to be employed for other purposes)

-   polishing the company's public image (whitewashing)

-   ambition
